      <h3>DEAR MANJU,</h3><br/>

          <p>I don't know from where should i start and what to say.There are so many things are going on from last three days.and i have no idea whats really going on around.we both are come really closed.</p>

          <p>I still remember that day when i saw your pictures.And my life is changed.i Have no idea how many times i went to your profile.whenever i saw your pic. My eyes are always falling on you."THE way U LOOK!","THE WAY YOU SMILE!" it gaved me goosebumps.The feeling you gave me i cant describe you in the words.</p>

          <p>I still remember the first time we chat. it never feels likes that i am talking with someone stranger.It feels like "I AM TALKING TO SOMEONE THAT I KNOW THIS PERSON FROM VERY LONG PERIOD." we talk so much about us.</p>
          <p>Now you are world to me. "I dont know how much long we go!". I dont know "what happen next"! when we meet.you are far away from me but not away from my heart.now you are so special to me. </p>
          <p>I belive that whatever happens in life there is reason behind that?. Thats why we meet.I am afraid to loose you.</p>

          <p>MANJU my feeling for you will never change.manju "I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! YOU ARE WORLD TO ME" you gave me a feeling that I cant  describe you.The feeling of LOVE.</p>
          <p>I am praying so that one day we meet.</p>
          <p>I want to sit with you near lake. Holding your hand.Your head in my shoulder.No one is around. just you and me and just loveing each other.cuddle you! kiss you on your forehead.</p>
